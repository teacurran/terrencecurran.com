After sitting idle for almost 10 years, I am working to revive this blog. 

I have converted the site from Wordpress to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  Wordpress was just too much maintenance.  I found myself logging in every few months to upgrade pluigins and install patches just to make sure the site doesn't get hacked.  Using Jekyll, the site is hosted entirely from static HTML files secured on s3.  There is no longer any risk of SQL injection, or a PHP exploit.

I used [this wordpress exporter plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter) which worked perfectly and did most fo the hard work.

This will be my first test post.
